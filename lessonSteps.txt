let x = "string";
var x = "string2";//similar, don't worry about the difference for now

let x = "string2";//breaks because "let" defines the starting point

x.length();// doesn't work
x.charAt(3);

//I want to know everyone's salary, how do we break this CSV down 
// to get at that data?
// Google: node csv
//	https://stackabuse.com/reading-and-writing-csv-files-with-node-js/

//Discuss NPM and package managers
npm install csv-parser

//https://www.npmjs.com/package/csv-parser

/*We now have a node-modules folder with a ton of crap, we actually got a bunch of libraries
code builds on code on code, javascript is especially crazy about this
we also have a package-lock.json file which is used for a bunch of stuff you don't care about for now
*/

// Now we can add
const csv = require('csv-parser');

// and we can read from the file by adding the parser which uses what are called "events"
// note also that the functions look a little different, this is just shorthand
